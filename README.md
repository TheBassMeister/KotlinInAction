# KotlinInAction
This repo is my attempt at recreating Spring in Action using only Kotlin. This will be a great exercise to write RESTful Spring boot apps in Kotlin

This is my attempt at writing a full RESTful Spring boot app using Kotlin and Gradle as a build too. It is inspired by Spring in Action.

Currently this project has all the repos and a REST Api (under localhost:8080/api if you start it from your local machine) completely written in Kotlin. It also has a basic Spring security implementation. Currently I am working on finalizing the Kafka listeners and Kafka producers to send messages to create some order objects.

In the near future this project will also have a basic not very fancy UI and will be enhanced by things like Spring AOP and Spring Batch.
