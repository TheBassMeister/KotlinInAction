# KotlinInAction
This repo is my attempt at recreating Spring in Action using only Kotlin. This will be a great exercise to write RESTful Spring boot apps in Kotlin

This is my attempt at writing a full RESTful Spring boot app using Kotlin and Gradle as a build too. It is inspired by Spring in Action. This repo is a personal 
exercise to be fit for any future roles as Kotlin or Java Spring boot developer
